#thank you to Mynah Marie from earth to abigal for being a code wrangler aka beta tester and critic
#check out her website at www.earthtoabigail.com
#i used very basic commands for the most part and found code snippets i liked and played around with them.
#I dont know if taking code snippets
#and tweaking them is frowned Upon but in order for me to learn how to use this program i had to play and tinker with code.
#if this makes me a thief so be it -- i will stop rambling now <3 lady B
