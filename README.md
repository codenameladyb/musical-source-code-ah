## Welcome to codename: lady b on Github!
Here you will find the code behind all my music. 
I write my music in a program called Sonic Pi, it is writte by Sam Aaron and was originally designed to help kids learn about coding though the medium of coding music. yet this program as evolved to allow anyone to learn to code music and perform it to other people (this is called live coding)
